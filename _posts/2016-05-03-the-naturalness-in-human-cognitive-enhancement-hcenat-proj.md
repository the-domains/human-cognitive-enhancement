The Naturalness in Human Cognitive Enhancement (HCENAT) project comprises a new international research partnership in the field of Human Cognitive Enhancement (HCE), with the objective of providing clear and accessible HCE-related analysis, guidelines and directions for policymakers, stakeholders, engineers and consumers.

Its goal is to create a philosophically grounded, open and transparent framework for description, assessment and forecast of acceptability of HCE systems in public space and by society, as well as for HCE governance issues. The project is coordinated by The Department of Interdisciplinary Activities at the University of West Bohemia. Other members include Charles University in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Prague Psychiatric Center, The Department of Cybernetics at University of West Bohemia and The University College of Gj√∏vik, Faculty of Health, Care and Nursing. The HCENAT project began in 2013 and will end in 2017\. The project is funded by Norway Grants.

The Research Group on Responsible Innovation is responsible for research on the ethics of HCE and a work package on the governance of HCE. Two key factors underpin the need for ethically sensitive policy - making and governance approaches to HCE. First, entrenched ethical debate between proponents ("transhumanists" or "post-humanists") and opponents of cognitive enhancement means that commentators are at risk of talking past each other, while there is a dearth of scientific and sociological empirical evidence to support claims regarding the efficiency and use of existing technologies. Second, the increased feasibility of some HCE applications such as pharmaceutical enhancers or "smart drugs" and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques highlights the need to address important ethical and policy questions for applications that are already feasible or will be in the near future. The research group has already offered a proposal for how to address a variety of ethical concerns and arguments in the HCE field, identifying and assessing a range of ethics assessment frameworks that can be usefully employed by policymakers in HCE. In the next phase of research, the group will develop priorities for a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework for HCE.
